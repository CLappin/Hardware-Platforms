# Hardware Platforms for Libero v12.1
Thiis repository contains sample board designs for Libero v12.1 and support that version of Libero only. The designs can be built with either AXI or AHB buses. These are not fully built projects but, .tcl scripts that need to be executed in Libero to build and implement a project. If you are interested only in the programming files for your device, then download the programming file contained within the selected project's repository and use fpexpress to implement it on your device.
##### Notes
- Check this repository for updates on regular basis.
- Ensure you always have the latest Cores downloaded in Libero.
- Master branch contains latest updates not full releases, scripts are not guaranteed to work.
- If you have any queries be sure to jest the [F.A.Q's](https://github.com/MiV-Libero-Designs/Sample-Board-Solutions/tree/master/FAQ) page in the repository

## Instructions
1. Select one of the sample board designs from the list below by clicking on it's name.
2. Download or Clone the selected repository, extract it wherever you want your Libero project built.
3. Follow the instructions on the project's page to implement the design, ensure your version of Libero matches the version for which the scripts are written.
